# FirstHTMLProject
So, This is my first HTML project after learning HTML from @gitdagray, and the idea for this project is taken from his YouTube video. <br>
This project is about a shop named "Little Taco Shop" <br>
I made a simple neat website for them which contains their home page, store hours & contact details. Furthermore, it contains about the shop, menu, timings,etc.
